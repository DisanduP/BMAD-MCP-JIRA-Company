# TODO App Frontend

React frontend for the TODO application with Jira integration.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant UI updates with backend sync
- **Jira Integration**: Displays Jira issue keys and sync status
- **Modern UI**: Clean interface built with Tailwind CSS

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The app will run on `http://localhost:3000`

3. Make sure the backend is running on `http://localhost:3001`

## Components

### App
Main application component that manages state and API calls.

### TaskList
Displays all tasks with completion toggles, edit/delete buttons, and Jira issue info.

### TaskForm
Form for creating new tasks or editing existing ones.

## API Integration

The frontend connects to the backend API at `http://localhost:3001/api/tasks`:

- `GET /api/tasks` - Fetch all tasks
- `POST /api/tasks` - Create new task
- `PUT /api/tasks/:id` - Update task
- `DELETE /api/tasks/:id` - Delete task

## Jira Integration

- Tasks display their associated Jira issue key
- Status changes sync automatically with Jira
- New tasks create corresponding Jira issues

## Technologies

- **React**: UI framework
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling
- **Fetch API**: HTTP requests
- **React Hooks**: State management

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
